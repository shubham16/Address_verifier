This is an Address verifier program that currently only supports Indian addresses.
Some Indian addresses can still not be detected mainly because I am not too sure about whether the pincode database that I got from govt of India website is complete(these govt websites, right).

It takes input from the file address.txt.The input format is to be specified as:
Line 1: Street name/ Apt Number
Line 2: City name
LIne 3: State name
Line 4: Pincode

The program uses a pincode database that maps pincode to the respective city.This information is stored in pincode.csv file.
The algorithm that is used involves the following steps:

1.Find the given pincode in the pincode database.If this pinocode doesn't exist, then this is an invalid address, else proceed further.
2.Store the city corresponding to the pincode.
3.Now the program parses the string address and hits the google geocode api to retrieve a json file.
4.This json file stores all the data related to that address.Now the program just retrieves the city name from json file.If both the city names match only then it is a valid address.

Eg. If input is 
Sector 10
Gurgaon 
Faridabad
122001

then after string parsing the program will hit this url:
https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=Sector+10++Gurgaon+key=AIzaSyCk05HoXI0NyBl2dVclxm3NOXNKIn-ck-4

Uses:
One use could be in address verification of fraudulent users on e-commerce websites.
I ran this program on a lot of test cases that even big e-commerce websites failed to detect correctly and placed the order for the city.

Eg. 
Sector 121
Faridabad
Haryana
121001
There is no sector 121 in faridabad, haryana but e-commerce websites placed my order for this address.
On running the program for this test case, we get Invalid address.
